[[custom-frontends]]
== Working with custom frontends

*_Canard_* is a facade for multiplatform developers that need an easy way to log without worrying about platform specific implementation. For that we provide xref:usage.adoc#default-frontends[[default frontends]] that are default output capacities, for each possible target of Kotlin/Multiplatform.

However, we can think of a lot of use cases that might not covered by default frontends, ike saving the logs into a file, sending the logs to an upstream system, etc.

If you want to use a custom implementation to handle your logs, you can create your own by using the interface `LogFrontend`.

[source,kotlin]
.`logFrontend`
----
public fun interface LogFrontend {
    public fun getReceiverFor(tag: Logger.Tag): LogReceiver // <1>
}
----
<1> You only have to override `getReceiverFor`.

The `getReceiverFor` function will define what we should do of every logged entry. The rest depends on your use case. Here is an example of a frontend that will stack every log into a list:

[source,kotlin]
.custom frontend
----
class MemoryFrontend : LogFrontend { // <1>
    val entries: MutableList<Triple<Logger.Tag, Logger.Entry, String?>> = ArrayList() // <2>

    override fun getReceiverFor(tag: Logger.Tag): LogReceiver = // <3>
        LogReceiver { entry, message -> // <4>
            entries += Triple(tag, entry, message) // <5>
        }
}
----
<1> implement `LogFrontend`
<2> create a mutable list that will carry the logs
<3> override `getReceiveFor`
<4> create a `LogReceiver` ...
<5> ... that populate the `entries` with each log received

NOTE: We could use this example to periodically send our stack to an upstream server.
