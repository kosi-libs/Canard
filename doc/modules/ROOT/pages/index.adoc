*_Canard_* is a lightweight Kotlin/Multiplatform logging library with a simple API, that works on JVM, Android, JavaScript, iOS, as well as for all Kotlin/Native targets.

*_Canard_* allows you to:

- easily setup logging in a Kotlin/Multiplatform
- simply log what you need on different level
- avoid carrying about platform specific frontends' implementations

*_Canard_* is a good choice because:

- it integrates nicely with all the Kotlin/Multiplatform targets
- it is small and simple to grasp with an easy and understandable API

== Example

[source, kotlin]
.simple example
----
val loggerFactory = LoggerFactory(defaultLogFrontend)
val logger = newLogger(loggerFactory)

logger.info { "Welcome to ..." }
logger.warning { "... the Canard documentation!" }
----
