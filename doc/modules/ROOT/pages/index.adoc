*_Kodein-Log_* is a Kotlin/Multiplatform lightweight logging library with a simple API, that works on JVM, Android, JavaScript, iOS, and generally for all Kotlin/Native targets.

*_Kodein-Log_* allows you to:
- easily setup logging in a Kotlin/Multiplatform
- simply log what you need on different level
- avoid carrying about platform specific frontends' implementations

*_Kodein-Log_* is a good choice because:
- it integrates nicely with all the Kotlin/Multiplatform targets
- it is small and simple to grasp with an easy and understandable API

.simple example

val loggerFactory = LoggerFactory(defaultLogFrontend)
val logger = newLogger(loggerFactory)
